# Change Drivers & Opportunities

# Vision Statement
The vision is to create a replacement of the current system using newer technologies. This will allow the end users to experience a more elegant and customizable experience with regards to the meal plans, all while minimizing the impact to their current workflow. This will be accomplished by migrating the logic behind the current implementation over to a web app.

1)	GV tries to minimize their processing time; food hampers for 150 families can be processed in as little as 10 minutes.
2)	Standard hampers are built for families of 4 and under and then for 4 or more. Contents can change brand and size, but the idea is to provide predictable content.
3)	Most clients visit once a month.
4)	Clients tend to be bad at planning. They have limited time and better planning would save them a lot of time. Time limits can cause them to buy convenience food which is more expensive and less healthy.
5)	The process for setting up clients on meal planner software is:
a)	1st client visit: 10 mins. Some personal details are recorded and initial filter parameters. Client is given a generic weekly meal plan to study.
b)	2nd client visit: 30 mins. Detailed diet review.
c)	3rd client visit: Issue 4-week plan and shopping lists.

# Business Objectives

•	Reduce time it takes for the client to design and complete a meal plan

# Technical Objectives
